--> Emergency patient routing in Python involves creating a system that optimally directs ambulances to 
    the nearest healthcare facilities based on real-time data.
--> Geospatial libraries like Google Maps API can be integrated with 
    Python to handle location-based calculations for ambulance routing.
-->Integration with GPS and GIS data can enhance the accuracy of location-based decisions in emergency patient 
   routing systems developed using Python
